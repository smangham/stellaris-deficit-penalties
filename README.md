[b]Version 3.2.*[/b]

In vanilla Stellaris, penalties don't scale with the size of resource deficits. Missing 1 food or 1000 has the same effect, making tiny oversights punishing and sweeping structural problems broadly ignorable.

This mod makes them scale with the [i]size[/i] of the deficit. For example:
[list]
[*]If you have an income of 100 food, but consume 150, you'll get a 33% reduction in population growth rate.
[*]If you have an income of 500 minerals, but consume 550, you'll get a 10% reduction in alloy and consumer goods production.
[/list]
The effect of the shortage can be seen in your "Empire Modifiers" list.

This should make it much harder to have sudden economic collapses triggered by a single, small shortfall, and hopefully help the AI recover from shortages better.

[h1]Details:[/h1]
At a 100% deficit (unreachable unless you have no income!), the penalties are:
[list]
	[*][b]Energy:[/b] -100% mineral production, ship damage & shield strength, army damage, -100 spy network levels.
	[*][b]Minerals:[/b] -100% alloy & consumer goods production, lithoid growth, -50% lithoid happiness.
	[*][b]Food:[/b] -100% bio pop growth & assembly rate, -50% bio pop happiness.
	[*][b]Alloys:[/b] -100% ship armour & fire rate, robot assembly rate.
	[*][b]Consumer Goods:[/b] -100% research & unity production, -50% happiness.
	[*][b]Exotic Gases, Rare Crystals, Volatile Motes:[/b] -25% output from pops.
[/list]
These are based on the vanilla deficit penalties, to keep things simple.

[h1]FAQ:[/h1]
[b]Can I still do the 'buy 1 unit from the market just before the end of the month' trick to avoid the effects of a deficit?[/b]
Yes, though given the penalty is no longer as harsh for small deficits, it's probably not worth your time.
[b]Does this account for catalytic production empires?[/b]
Yes! You'll see a slightly weird modifier that seems to [i]add[/i]  a flat amount of alloys as well as one that removes a %age amount, because of the way Paradox have implemented deficit penalties for the job, but it works.
